# Elite-102-Dinner-and-a-Movie-App
Sometimes you just canâ€™t decide what to have for dinner! Make a Dinner and a Movie matching website. Grab a random restaurant from Yelp and a random movie from The Movie Database using their public API endpoints and display the match up to the user. The user should be able to randomize the match up without refreshing the page.
